# dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files of UNIX/LINUX applications. This are configurations of *zaryob*


## i3wm Installation

It would be destroy your .config files on your home.

```
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zaryob/dotfiles/main/install.sh`"
```

## Extra Programs

neofetch and ncmcpp (and also mpd) added. You can use them up

## XDM

I use a simple black and white xdm config for my own. It needs to configure files under `/etc/X11/xdm`.

## For yadr and skwp dotfiles

There are such config files that I use them with [skwp's Dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) which is most 
beautiful dotfiles config for zsh/vim dotfiles to use it with MacOS X or other Unix programs.

## Services and Scripts

I'm using very expreimental stuff comes with third party support like OpenZFS for Root, etc. That's why I need some
extra stuff for extraordinary reasons (like service problem of `zpool` in openSUSE). I generally fix it with such kind 
of Services and scripts.

## Other systems

I'm using various systems including FreeBSD and Illumos. I gonna upload some pretty fixed that I use in that repository.
